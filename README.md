# Ride Booking API

🚖 A secure, scalable, and role-based backend API for a ride booking system (like Uber/Pathao) built with Express.js, Mongoose, and TypeScript.

---

## Project Overview

This API allows:

- Riders to request rides, cancel them, view ride history, rate drivers, and leave feedback.

- Drivers to accept rides, update ride status, set availability, and view earnings.

- Admins to manage users, approve/suspend drivers, view rides, and generate system stats.

All rides are stored with complete history, and the API implements JWT-based authentication, role-based authorization, and real-time location handling for drivers.

---

## Features

✅ JWT-based login & registration with three roles: admin, rider, driver.

✅ Secure password hashing using bcrypt.

✅ Role-based route protection.

✅ Rider features: request ride, cancel ride (within allowed window), view ride history, rate driver, leave feedback, find nearby drivers.

✅ Driver features: accept/reject ride requests, update ride status, view earnings, set availability (online/offline).

✅ Admin features: view all users, approve/suspend drivers, block/unblock accounts, view rides & statistics.

✅ Ride fare calculation based on distance.

✅ Geocoding addresses into coordinates using OpenStreetMap API.

✅ Full modular project structure for scalability.

## Ride Lifecycle

1. Requested – Rider requests a ride.
2. Accepted – Driver accepts the ride.
3. Picked Up – Rider is picked up.
4. In Transit – Ride is in progress.
5. Completed – Ride finished.
6. Cancelled – Rider cancels before acceptance.

All timestamps are recorded for audit and history.

---

## Role-Based Access

- Riders – Can request, cancel rides, rate drivers, leave feedback.
- Drivers – Can accept rides, update ride status, set availability, view earnings.
- Admins – Can manage users and rides, approve/suspend drivers, view statistics.

Routes are protected via JWT and role checks.

## Testing

- Postman collection can be used to test all endpoints.
- Health check:
```bash
GET /
Response: { message: "Ride Booking API is running!" }
```

## Future Enhancements

- Geo-based driver matching in real-time.
- Fare estimation based on dynamic pricing.
- Rider/Driver rating system enhancements.
- Admin dashboard analytics.
- WebSocket support for real-time ride tracking.
