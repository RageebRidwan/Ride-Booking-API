# Ride Booking API

üöñ A secure, scalable, and role-based backend API for a ride booking system (like Uber/Pathao) built with Express.js, Mongoose, and TypeScript.

---

## Project Overview

This API allows:

- Riders to request rides, cancel them, view ride history, rate drivers, and leave feedback.

- Drivers to accept rides, update ride status, set availability, and view earnings.

- Admins to manage users, approve/suspend drivers, view rides, and generate system stats.

All rides are stored with complete history, and the API implements JWT-based authentication, role-based authorization, and real-time location handling for drivers.

---

## Features

‚úÖ JWT-based login & registration with three roles: admin, rider, driver.

‚úÖ Secure password hashing using bcrypt.

‚úÖ Role-based route protection.

‚úÖ Rider features: request ride, cancel ride (within allowed window), view ride history, rate driver, leave feedback, find nearby drivers.

‚úÖ Driver features: accept/reject ride requests, update ride status, view earnings, set availability (online/offline).

‚úÖ Admin features: view all users, approve/suspend drivers, block/unblock accounts, view rides & statistics.

‚úÖ Ride fare calculation based on distance.

‚úÖ Geocoding addresses into coordinates using OpenStreetMap API.

‚úÖ Full modular project structure for scalability.

## Ride Lifecycle

1. Requested ‚Äì Rider requests a ride.
2. Accepted ‚Äì Driver accepts the ride.
3. Picked Up ‚Äì Rider is picked up.
4. In Transit ‚Äì Ride is in progress.
5. Completed ‚Äì Ride finished.
6. Cancelled ‚Äì Rider cancels before acceptance.

All timestamps are recorded for audit and history.

---

## Role-Based Access

- Riders ‚Äì Can request, cancel rides, rate drivers, leave feedback.
- Drivers ‚Äì Can accept rides, update ride status, set availability, view earnings.
- Admins ‚Äì Can manage users and rides, approve/suspend drivers, view statistics.

Routes are protected via JWT and role checks.

## Testing

- Postman collection can be used to test all endpoints.
- Health check:
```bash
GET /
Response: { message: "Ride Booking API is running!" }
```

## Future Enhancements

- Geo-based driver matching in real-time.
- Fare estimation based on dynamic pricing.
- Rider/Driver rating system enhancements.
- Admin dashboard analytics.
- WebSocket support for real-time ride tracking.
